	<title>Metering Shut-Off</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
	Station density is the average of all valid lanes for a sample period.
	"Current" density is the average of all samples in the last 60 seconds.
</p>
<p>
	There is a corridor-wide check which must pass at least once before any
	shut-off checks happen.
	For this check, there must be no bottlenecks at all on the entire
	corridor.
	Also, the average segment density from the furthest upstream station to
	the last bottleneck must be trending downward for each interval in the
	last 5 minutes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the average segment density from meter to bottleneck was above the
    desired density (29.6) for any interval in the last 5 minutes, continue
    metering.</li>
<li>If any bottleneck exists downstream, check demand at meter.
    If queue demand was lower than metering rate for all intervals in
    the last 5 minutes, shut off meter.</li>
<li>If no bottleneck exists for at least 5 minutes, shut off meter.</li>
<li>Otherwise, continue metering.</li>
</ul>
