<b>Definitions</b>
<dl>
	<dt>Density</dt>
	<dd>Vehicles per lane-mile</dd>
	<dt>Station Density</dt>
	<dd>Average of all valid lanes in a station for one sample period</dd>
	<dt>Interval Density</dt>
	<dd>Average of station samples during one 60 second interval</dd>
	<dt>Meter Segment</dt>
	<dd>A contiguous series of stations associated with a ramp meter.
	    It begins at the station just upstream of the meter.
	    The downstream end is the first bottleneck within 3 miles (or the
	    last station within 3 miles if no bottleneck exists).</dd>
	<dt>Segment Density</dt>
	<dd>Each consecutive pair of stations is divided into 3 equal links.
	    The first and last links are assigned density from the station
	    adjacent to them.
	    The middle link is assigned a density which is an average of the
	    two stations.
	    The segment density is an average of all links in the segment,
	    weighted by length.</dd>
</dl>
<b>Shut-Off</b>
<p>
	Before testing shut-off logic for a meter, the 15 minute segment density
	must be trending downward for each interval in the last 5 minutes,
	or the segment density must be below 24.05 vehicles / lane-mile.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the average segment density was above the desired density (29.6) for any
    interval in the last 5 minutes, continue metering.</li>
<li>If passage rate (60 second smoothed) was lower than metering rate for all
    intervals in the last 5 minutes, shut off meter.</li>
<li>If segment has no bottleneck for at least 5 minutes, shut off meter.</li>
<li>Otherwise, continue metering.</li>
</ul>
