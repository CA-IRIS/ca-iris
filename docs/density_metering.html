<p>
	A metering period begins and ends at specific times during the day.
	Within the metering period, a meter can be in one of 5 phases:
	<em>not started</em>, <em>early metering</em>, <em>metering</em>,
	<em>flushing</em> or <em>stopped</em>.
	When transition conditions are met, the meter moves to the next phase.
	If all meters on a corridor are in the <em>stopped</em> phase, the
	metering period ends.
</p>
<h3>Not Started Phase</h3>
<p>
	Ramp meters begin each metering period in the <em>not started</em>
	phase.
	In this phase, a ramp meter will not cycle.
	There are two conditions which can cause the meter to transition to the
	<em>early metering</em> phase:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Passage flow rate was greater than 80% of selected metering rate for each
    interval in 90 seconds.</li>
<li>Segment density was higher than bottleneck density for each interval in 90
    seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	When there are 30 minutes left in the metering period, the meter will
	transition from <em>not started</em> to <em>stopped</em>.
</p>
<h3>Early Metering Phase</h3>
<p>
	In the <em>early metering</em> phase, a ramp meter will cycle at the
	selected metering rate.
	There are three conditions which can cause the meter to transition to
	the <em>metering</em> phase:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Segment density (15 minute average) was trending lower for each interval in
    5 minutes.</li>
<li>Segment density (1 minute average) was lower than 65% of critical density.
</li>
<li>Only 30 minutes remain in the metering period.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Metering Phase</h3>
<p>
	In the <em>metering</em> phase, a ramp meter will cycle at the selected
	metering rate.
	The following conditions will cause the meter to transition to the
	<em>flushing</em> phase:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Segment density was below desired density (29.6) for every interval in 5
    minutes, AND</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Passage rate (60 second smoothed) was lower than metering rate for
        all intervals in 5 minutes, OR</li>
    <li>The segment had no bottleneck for 5 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Only 2 minutes remain in the metering period.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flushing Phase</h3>
<p>
	In the <em>flushing</em> phase, a ramp meter will cycle at the maximum
	metering rate.
	The following conditions will cause the meter to transition to the
	<em>stopped</em> phase:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The queue is estimated to be empty for 1 minute.</li>
<li>The metering period ends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stopped Phase</h3>
<p>
	In the <em>stopped</em> phase, a ramp meter will not cycle.
	There are two conditions which can cause the meter to transition back
	to the <em>metering</em> phase:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Passage flow rate was greater than 80% of selected metering rate for each
    interval in 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Segment density was higher than bottleneck density for each interval in 5
    minutes.</li>
</ul>

	<dd>Average of station samples during one 60 second interval</dd>
	<dt>Meter Segment</dt>
	<dd>A contiguous series of stations associated with a ramp meter.
	    It begins at the station just upstream of the meter.
	    The downstream end is the first bottleneck within 3 miles (or the
	    last station within 3 miles if no bottleneck exists).</dd>
	<dt>Segment Density</dt>
	<dd>Each consecutive pair of stations is divided into 3 equal links.
	    The first and last links are assigned density from the station
	    adjacent to them.
	    The middle link is assigned a density which is an average of the
	    two stations.
	    The segment density is an average of all links in the segment,
	    weighted by length.</dd>
