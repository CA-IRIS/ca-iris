<h1>Stratified Zone Metering</h1>
The objective of stratified zone metering is to delay the onset of congestion
for as long as possible, while restricting meter wait times to no more than 4
minutes (2 for freeway-to-freeway meters). Since congestion is primarily
caused by flow rates greater than sustainable capacity, the goal is to keep
the flow at or below capacity at all points on the mainline. This is
accomplished as fairly as possible, with each ramp being metered according to
its demand. Another benefit of stratified zone metering is that it selects
reasonable metering rates even if many detectors fail.
<h2>Data Sampling and Filtering</h2>
Traffic sensors, or detectors, provide data in the form of volume (number of
vehicles) and occupancy (percent of time with a vehicle "occupying" the
detector). Volume and occupancy data are collected in 30 second samples. In
this document, all volume samples <b>(V)</b> are first converted to an hourly
flow rate <b>(G)</b>. The conversion is straightforward:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(1)</span>
G = V * 120 (samples per hour)
</div>
<p>
Since 30 second samples are very volatile, a smoothing function is used to
filter data. The function is iterative; every sampling period, the previous
result of the function <b>(F<sub>t-1</sub>)</b> is a parameter, along with
the current sample <b>(G<sub>t</sub>)</b>. The function is also supplied with
a constant <b>(K)</b>, which determines the rate of smoothing.
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(2)</span>
	F<sub>t</sub> = F<sub>t-1</sub> + K * (G<sub>t</sub> - F<sub>t-1</sub>)
</div>
<p>
The constant <b>(K)</b> can range from 0 to 1. With <b>K = 1</b>, smoothing
is disabled, but changes become more gradual as <b>K</b> approaches zero. The
smoothing function also requires an initial value <b>(F<sub>0</sub>)</b>, for
the first iteration.
<h2>Demand</h2>
Ramp meter demand <b>(D)</b> is the flow rate of vehicles entering the ramp.
Under normal conditions, the queue detector flow rate <b>(Q)</b> is a direct
measurement of vehicles entering the ramp. The queue flow rate is filtered
through the smoothing function, with <b>K</b> set to 0.15:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(3)</span>
	D<sub>t</sub> = D<sub>t-1</sub> +
		0.15 * (Q<sub>t</sub> - D<sub>t-1</sub>)
		; where D<sub>0</sub> = 240 vehicles per hour
</div>
<p>
When the queue extends beyond the queue detector, the flow rate is no longer
an accurate measure of demand, because the number of vehciles waiting upstream
is unknown. This condition results in high occupancy at the queue detector. If
it is greater than a threshold of 25%, an alternate method must be used to
calculate demand. When the queue is in this condition, the demand is increased
incrementally until the occupancy drops below the threshold again. The step
increment (every 30 seconds) is 150 vehicles per hour, which will cause the
demand to reach the maximum release rate in less than 5 minutes.
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(4)</span>
	D<sub>t</sub> = D<sub>t-1</sub> + 150 (where D<sub>t</sub> &lt;= 1714)
</div>
<p>
If there is no queue detector, or in the case of a detector malfunction, the
flow rate at the passage detector <b>(P)</b> is used to estimate the "passage
demand". Since the passage detector is downstream of the meter, it cannot truly
measure demand, so an extra 15% is added to prevent excessive queueing:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(5)</span>
	D<sub>t</sub> = D<sub>t-1</sub> +
		0.15 * (1.15 * P<sub>t</sub> - D<sub>t-1</sub>)
</div>
<p>
In either of these cases (high occupancy or no queue detector data) the
minimum release rate for the meter cannot be less than the demand (see next
section). This is an extra safeguard to prevent longer wait times than
desired.
<h2>Minimum Release Rate</h2>
The minimum meter release rate is designed to prevent the wait time from
exceding the maximum allowed wait time (normally 4 minutes), while allowing
very restrictive rates for short periods of time. Since the demand calculation
takes care of the case where vehicles are backed up to the queue detector, the
worst-case queue is from the queue detector to the meter itself. Knowing the
maximum number of vehicles which could be waiting in the queue, the minimum
release rate is set so that no vehicle will ever wait longer than the maximum
allowed time.
<p>
The maximum number of vehicles in the queue is calculated using the queue
storage length <b>(L)</b> and the queue density <b>(N)</b>. The queue storage
length is defined as the length (in feet) on the ramp where vehicles may be
stored between the ramp meter and the queue detector. Because the queue
occupancy threshold is relatively low (25%), it is assumed that the queue will
be about 100 feet from the queue detector when the occupancy reaches the
threshold. This means that the queue storage length is 100 feet less than the
distance from the queue detector to the meter, times the number of lanes on the
ramp (normally two).
<p>
The queue density is estimated using the current meter release rate <b>(R)</b>,
filtered through the smoothing function, with <b>K</b> set to 0.2. The result
of this calculation is called the accumulated release rate
<b>(R<sup>a</sup>)</b>:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(6)</span>
	R<sup>a</sup><sub>t</sub> = R<sup>a</sup><sub>t-1</sub> +
		0.2 * (R<sub>t</sub> - R<sup>a</sup><sub>t-1</sub>)
		; where R<sup>a</sup><sub>0</sub> = 1714 vehicles per hour
</div>
<p>
The queue density <b>(N)</b> is affected by the accumulated release rate. With
slower release rates, the queue becomes more dense. This reletionship is not
fully understood, but the following equation will provide a reasonable
estimate:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(7)</span>
	N = (2280 - R<sup>a</sup>) / 8
</div>
<p>
Knowing the queue density and the storage length, the maximum possible number
of stored vehicles <b>(T)</b> can be computed:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(8)</span>
	T = N * L / 5280 (feet per mile)
</div>
<p>
To limit any vehicle's wait time, divide the maximum number of stored vehicles
into the maximum allowed wait time to get the maximum cycle time
<b>(C<sup>max</sup>)</b>:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(9)</span>
	C<sup>max</sup> = 240 (seconds in 4 minutes) / T
</div>
<p>
Converting the maximum cycle time to a minimum release rate
<b>(R<sup>min</sup>)</b> is simple:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(10)</span>
	R<sup>min</sup> = 3600 (seconds per hour) / C<sup>max</sup>
</div>
<p>
For example, let's take a ramp with a queue detector 400 feet upstream from
the meter. Subtracting 100 feet and multiplying by 2 lanes, we get a queue
storage length of 600 feet. Let's also assume that the maximum wait time at
this meter is 4 minutes (240 seconds). Now, we'll assume that the release rate
selected is always the minimum release rate. The following table demonstrates
how this works.

<sup>*</sup> The absolute minimum release rate is 240 vehicles per hour, which
corresponds to 15 seconds per vehicle.
<p>
The minimum release rate can be problematic if the queue detector is located
too far upstream of the ramp meter. In that situation, if the demand is not
high enough, it will prevent a queue from ever forming at the meter. Because
of this problem, the minimum release rate is never set higher than the
"passage demand" as long as the queue detector occupancy is below the
threshold.
<h2>Zones</h2>
Detector stations are spaced evenly every half mile on the mainline. Each
segment of freeway from a half mile to 3 miles in length constitutes a unique
"zone", using detector stations as endpoints. The basic idea of the zone is to
keep the vehicle "inputs" less than the "outputs," which are defined as
follows:
<dl>
<dt>Inputs:</dt>
<dd><dl>
	<dt>(M) Metered entrances
	<dd>The result of the zone calculation is the total allowed release
	    rate for the ramps in the zone.
	<dt>(A) Upstream mainline volume
	<dd>The upstream volume station is the beginning of the zone. The
	    measured flow rate is filtered using the smoothing function.
	<dt>(U) Unmetered entrances
	<dd>All unmetered entrance onto the mainline, such as an HOV (High
	    Occupancy Vehicle) bypass ramp, fall into this category. The
	    total flow rate is filtered through the smoothing function.
</dl></dd>
<dt>Outputs:</dt>
<dd><dl>
	<dt>(X) Exits
	<dd>All ramps exiting the mainline fall into this category. The total
	    flow rate is filtered through the smoothing function.
	<dt>(S) Spare capacity
	<dd>The idea of "spare capacity" is to figure out whether the zone is
	    empty or full. Each mainline station within the zone (including
	    the endpoints) is used for this purpose. The current occupancy
	    from each <b>(S)</b> detector is used to calculate the "density"
	    (vehicles per mile). If the average density in the zone is less
	    than 32 vehicles per mile, then that difference multiplied by the
	    number of lane-miles in the zone is the spare capacity. Bad
	    detectors are not included in the average density calculation.
	<dt>(B) Downstream mainline capacity
	<dd>The downstream station is the end of the zone. It has traditionally
	    been called the "bottleneck", though it will not represent a real
	    bottleneck in all zones. The value used for this term is the
	    expected mainline capacity at that location. It will be set to
	    1800 vehicles per hour for the right lane, and 2200 vehicles per
	    hour for all other lanes.
</dl></dd>
</dl>
This relationship is described as:
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(11)</span>
	M + A + U &lt;= B + X + S
</div>
or:
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(12)</span>
	M &lt;= B + X + S - A - U
</div>
<p>
The zone calculation yields the maximum allowed metering rate <b>(M)</b> for
the set of meters between the upstream station <b>(A)</b> and the downstream
station <b>(B)</b>. This result is a metering "rule", which consists of a set
of meters and a maximum release rate which must be applied to them. Some
example rules might look like this:
<p>
<div class="math">
	{ Valley View Rd }: 630<br>
	{ Valley View Rd, T.H.62 EB, T.H.62 WB }: 1620<br>
	{ Valley View Rd, T.H.62 EB, T.H.62 WB, Bren Rd }: 1900<br>
</div>
<p>
Under certain conditions, a zone must be disqualified from setting metering
rates. If any detector in the upstream mainline volume station <b>(A)</b>
malfunctions, the zone is disqualified. Also, if there is a drop in density
greater than 50 vehciles per mile from one mainline station to the next
downstream station, the zone is disqualified. This condition indicates a
probable incident, making zone-based metering inappropriate.
<p>
Because there are so many overlapping zones, mainline detector failures do not
have much impact on the algorithm. Unfortunately, there is no redundancy in
ramp detector data. Specifically, exit and unmetered entrance ramp detectors
provide important data for the zone calculations. When these detectors fail,
the missing data must be replaced by "fake" data, handled on a case-by-case
basis. Here are two possible strategies for generating "fake" data:
<ul>
<li>Calculate the difference between flow data from detectors upstream and
downstream of the ramp, filtered using a very small K (0.01).
<li>Associate another detector (which has a similar demand pattern) and a
percentage to apply to its data. For example, this might be a right lane
mainline detector just upstream of an exit, where 60% of vehicles in that lane
are exiting.
</ul>


<h2>Layers</h2>
The multitude of zones defined by this metering strategy are divided into
six groups, called "layers." The first layer contains all zones consisting of
exactly 2 stations (1/2 mile in length). The second layer has all zones with
exactly 3 stations (1 mile in length). And so on, up to the sixth layer, which
has zones with 7 stations (3 miles in length). See table 3 for a summary.
<p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<caption>Table 2: Layers and Zone Lengths</caption>
<th>Layer<th>Stations<th>Length
<tr><td class="top">1<td class="top">2<td class="top">0.5 mile
<tr><td>2<td>3<td>1 mile
<tr><td>3<td>4<td>1.5 mile
<tr><td>4<td>5<td>2 mile
<tr><td>5<td>6<td>2.5 mile
<tr><td>6<td>7<td>3 mile
</table>
<p>
The layers are processed in order, and within each layer the zones are
processed from upstream to downstream. See <a href="example.html">table 3</a>
for an example of how this works on a stretch of freeway. Once all the zones
have been calculated, the result is a large set of rules.
<h2>Rule Processing</h2>
Once the set of rules has been generated for a freeway corridor, the meter
release rates must be set so that they "obey" all the rules. To accomplish
this, the rules are processed one at a time. First, the rule demand
<b>(D<sup>rule</sup>)</b> is calculated by summing the demand of all meters
affected by the rule.
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(13)</span>
	D<sup>rule</sup> = D<sup>1</sup> + D<sup>2</sup> + ... + D<sup>n</sup>
</div>
<p>
Each meter is assigned a "proposed" rate <b>(R<sup>p</sup>)</b>. This is
allocated from the rule's release rate <b>(M<sup>rule</sup>)</b>, in the same
ratio as meter demand to rule demand.
<p>
<div class="math">
<span class="func">(14)</span>
	R<sup>p</sup> = M<sup>rule</sup> * D / D<sup>rule</sup>
</div>
<p>
The rule balance is then computed by comparing the proposed release rates with
the actual and minimum release rates. The actual release rate for a meter
defaults to the maximum release rate (1714 vehicles per hour), but may have
been reduced by a rule processed earlier. For each meter, if the proposed rate
is less than the minimum rate, the rule balance is reduced by the difference.
On the other hand, if the proposed rate is greater than the actual release
rate, the rule balance is increased by the difference.
<p>
If the rule balance is below zero, each meter which reduced the balance has
its release rate <b>(R)</b> set to the minimum rate. The rule is then
processed again, with each of these meters temporarily "removed", and its
release rate subtracted from <b>M<sup>rule</sup></b>.
<p>
If the rule balance is above zero, the rule is processed again, with each
meter which increased the balance temporarily "removed", and its release rate
subtracted from <b>M<sup>rule</sup></b>.
<p>
When the rule balance becomes zero, the rule processing is complete, and all
release rates are set to the proposed rates. The rule is then restored to its
original state. Each meter is "controlled" by the rule if its release rate was
reduced by the rule.
<p>
After all the rules have been processed, there may be a need to "fix" some
rules. A rule needs to be fixed if another rule, processed later, makes one or
more of its meters more restrictive. If this condition is not fixed, then the
other meters controlled by that rule would be more restrictive than necessary.
To fix the broken rules, first they must be identified. This is done by
scanning the rules in reverse order. A rule which is controlling a meter is
considered "broken" if the sum of the release rates for all the rule's meters
is less than <b>M<sup>rule</sup></b>. When a broken rule is found, all meters
controlled by it have their release rate set to the maximum rate. Then, all
the rules are processed again, in the original processing order. This fixing
process is repeated for each broken rule.
<h2>Operation</h2>
For each peak period, each freeway corridor has a "window" of time when
metering can occur. Even before the meter begins operation, the accumulated
release rate <b>(R<sup>a</sup>)</b> is calculated from the release rates called
for by the algorithm. After the start time, a meter will begin operation when
the demand <b>(D)</b> is greater than 80% of <b>R<sup>a</sup></b>. After the
midpoint of the window, any meter will shut off if the demand is less than 70%
of the accumulated release rate. The meter may turn back on if the demand rises
above 85% of the accumulated release rate. At the end time, before being shut
off, all operating meters will be set to the maximum release rate for one
minute to avoid releasing a platoon of vehicles.
