<p>
The roadway network geometrics are described in the static tms_config.xml.gz
file.
Every point of interest on the network is described by an <em>r_node</em>.
These can represent entrances, exits, <em>stations</em>, interchanges, or
access nodes.
Each r_node has a <em>downstream</em> attribute which links it with all r_nodes
immediately downstream (with the flow of traffic).
Each r_node also has an associated UTM coordinate pair (easting and northing).
Since UTM points are in meter units, it is trivial to calculate the distance
from one r_node to the next.
Most station nodes have a set of <em>detectors</em>, which can be sampled for
average vehicle speed data.
</p>
<p>
A <em>corridor</em> is a list of all r_nodes on one direction of a freeway,
from the upstream end to the downstream end.
Note that even though I-494 and I-94 both have North/South sections, the
corridors are defined as Eastbound and Westbound only.
</p>
<p>
An access node is a special node which provides a means to link the freeway
network with the "surface" streets.
The downstream attribute of an access node at I-494 &amp; France Ave would
contain all entrance nodes onto I-494 from France Ave.
Also, all exit nodes from I-494 to France Ave would contain that access node
in their downstream attributes.
</p>
<h2>Steps to Calculate Travel Time</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Select origin and destination access nodes</li>
    <li>Determine route(s) using a pathfinding algorithm, using the downstream
	attributes to link r_nodes together</li>
    <li>Calculate travel time for each route (see below)</li>
    <li>Choose best route</li>
    <li>Present travel time and route to user</li>
</ol>

<h2>Steps to Calculate Route Travel Time</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Split route into corridor trips at freeway interchanges</li>
    <li>Estimate travel time on each corridor</li>
    <ol class='alpha'>
	<li>Create list of all r_nodes from station upstream of corridor origin
	    (entrance) to station downstream of corridor destination (exit)</li>
	<li>Calculate distance along corridor for each r_node (using
	    distance from one UTM point to the next r_node)</li>
	<li>Convert distance from meters to miles (divide by 1609.344 m/mi)</li>
	<li>Calculate running average and running low speed for each
	    station</li>
	<ol class='roman'>
	    <li>Apply speed limits to each detector speed</li>
	    <li>Average speed is average of all valid detector speeds</li>
	    <li>Low speed is minimum of all valid detector speeds</li>
	    <li>Average last four intervals (2 minutes)</li>
	    <li>If &lt; 25 mph, extend to last six intervals (3 minutes)</li>
	    <li>If &lt; 20 mph, extend to last eight intervals (4 minutes)</li>
	    <li>If &lt; 15 mph, extend to last ten intervals (5 minutes)</li>
	</ol>
	<li>If distance between any two consecutive valid stations is greater
	    than 1.5 miles: ABORT (data not reliable)</li>
	<li>Split distance between each consecutive (valid) station into
	    three equal-length links</li>
	<ol class='roman'>
	    <li>First link uses speeds from upstream station</li>
	    <li>Second link uses average of upstream/downstream speeds</li>
	    <li>Third link uses speeds from downstream station</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Split the links at entrance and exit point</li>
	<li>Split the link at one mile before exit point</li>
	<li>Estimate travel time for each link from entrance to exit point</li>
	<ol class='roman'>
	    <li>Divide link length (mi) by link speed (mph) to get link time
		(hours)</li>
	    <li>Use low speed within one mile of exit (turning penalty)</li>
	    <li>Otherwise, use average speed</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Add link times to get corridor travel time</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Add turning delay for each freeway interchange</li>
    <ol class='alpha'>
	<li>Turning delay assumed to be 1 minute</li>
	<li>May be refined in future</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Calculate maximum displayable travel time</li>
    <ol class='alpha'>
	<li>Find total route length (miles)</li>
	<li>Divide total route length by minimum overall speed (15 mph) to get
	    maximum travel time (hours)</li>
	<li>Convert maximum travel time to minutes, rounding up to the next
	    5 minutes (5 * ceil(hours * 12))</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If travel time &gt; maximum displayable time, use OVER x MIN
	style message</li>
</ol>
