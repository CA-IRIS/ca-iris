This paper contains a method for modelling a roadway network.
Every point of interest on the roadway network is described by an <b>r_node</b>.
An r_node can represent a detector station, entrance ramp, exit ramp, etc.
An <b>r_link</b> is the span of roadway which links two r_nodes together.
A <b>corridor</b> is an ordered list of all r_nodes associated with one
direction of a roadway.
</p>
<h2>R_node</h2>
<p>
The r_node contains information about the roadway node.

<p>
The location table contains freeway, cross-street, and UTM coordinates.
For a ramp r_node, the location coordinate is defined as the gore point,
where the ramp merges onto, or splits off from the freeway.
Mainline station nodes are usually associated with a detector station, in which
case the location is the coordinates of the detectors.
This is not mandatory however, as sometimes extra "shape nodes" need to be
specified for a curved section to allow for better distance estimation.

The node_type parameter is a key into the node_type look-up table.
Station nodes describe a mainline detector station.
Entrance nodes represent an entrance ramp onto a corridor.
Exit nodes represent an exit ramp from a corridor.
Intersection nodes represent at-grade intersections, possibly signalized.
</p>
<p>
Access and interchange nodes are special nodes used for traveller information
systems.

<p>
Transition describes how entrance or exit nodes connect with linked nodes.
A loop transition is for ramp movements which form a loop (eg. an Eastbound to
Northbound movement in a cloverleaf interchange).
A leg transition is for simple "leg" movements (eg. any ramp on a diamond
interchange).
A slipramp applies for short ramps connecting parallel roadways.
A CD transition is like a slipramp, except the roadways are considered to
be the same for rendering purposes.
An HOV transition is for a ramp meter bypass ramp.
</p>
<p>
For an entrance node, transition describes what type of ramp is entering.
An entrance node with "none" for the transition can be used for mainline
metering (most commonly on a CD road).
If an entrance node has a transition of "common", that indicates that two
roadways join to form a <b>common section</b>.
</p>
<p>
For an exit node, transition describes what type of ramp is exiting.
If an exit node has a transition of "common", that indicates that all
lanes exit from the mainline &mdash; to form a common section. In this case,
the exit node will not be linked with the next downstream node in the corridor.
</p>
<p>
For a station, intersection, access, or interchange node, the transition must
be "none".
</p>

<dt id='r_node_lanes'>lanes</dt>

For a ramp node, this is the number of lanes entering or exiting the mainline.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id='r_node_attach_side'>attach_side</dt>
<dd>boolean; true if node is attached on left side of the roadway
<p>
This flag indicates which side of the road the r_node is attached.
For entrance or exit ramps, this determines which side of the road the ramp
is on.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id='r_node_shift'>shift</dt>
<dd>integer; lane shift to attach side of node
<p>
This is the lane shift from the corridor reference lane to the attach side of
the road, just downstream of the node.
This value can be used for lane continuity analysis within a corridor.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id='r_node_station_id'>station_id</dt>

The station_id is a unique identifier for the detectors associated with the

It is not limited to station type nodes.
</p>

<p>
This is the posted speed limit at the r_node.
The units should be dependent on locale (miles per hour or kilometers per hour).
For ramp r_nodes, it may be used to indicate the advisory speed limit on the
ramp.

<h2>Automatic Linking</h2>
<p>
The links connecting r_nodes are dynamically created based on location and
other attributes.
An r_link is a directional (one-way) link from one r_node to another.
From a set of r_nodes, the r_links can be automatically created.
</p>
<h3>Corridor Linking</h3>
<p>
To create the links for one corridor, all r_nodes with matching freeway
and direction are found.
These nodes are sorted based on location, from the upstream end to the
downstream end.
This is done by linking each r_node with its two nearest neighbors, based on
the UTM coordinates.
An r_link is created for each successive r_node pair, unless the r_node is
an exit with a transition of "common".
In that case, the link enters a "common section", and only returns to the
main corridor at the end of the common section.
</p>
<h3>Ramp Linking</h3>
<p>
Also, r_links must be created for freeway-to-freeway ramps and CD road ramps.
Each "exit" r_node is matched with a corresponding "entrance" node on another
corridor.
The matching is performed by swapping the "freeway", "freeway direction" pair
with the "cross street", "cross street direction" pair.
For example, an "exit" node from Hwy 62 EB to Hwy 100 NB would be matched with
an "entrance" node on Hwy 100 NB from Hwy 62 EB.
Two roadways will match if the names are the same, with one having an optional
suffix.
So, for example, "I-394" and "I-394 CD" will match.
If there are multiple matching nodes for a given entrance or exit, the
<em>closest</em> matching node is used, by computing the linear distance
between the UTM points.
</p>
<p>
Mainline metering entrance r_nodes (with a transition of "none") are not linked.
</p>
<h3>Intersection Linking</h3>
<p>
Each intersection node is matched with other intersection nodes.
These nodes must have the "freeway" and "cross street" swapped, regardless of
direction.
For example, suppose the intersection is Hwy 169 NB @ Frontage Rd.
This node will link to both EB and WB intersection nodes on Frontage Rd.
</p>
<h3>Access and Interchange Linking</h3>
<p>
An access node is any access point onto or off of the roadway network.
These nodes do not specify direction, and are linked to all entrance and exit
nodes with matching freeway and cross street.
For example an access node at I-494 and France Ave would be matched with an
exit node from I-494 EB to France Ave NB.
The UTM location of an access node is roughly defined as the point where the
two roads intersect (if any).
They are used for traveller information systems to allow a user to select
an origin or destination point.
Interchange nodes are like access nodes, except they are used for route
selection instead of origin/destination.
</p>
<h2>Collector-Distributor Roads</h2>
<p>
A <em>collector-distributor road</em> (CD) is a road which runs parallel to a
freeway.
Its purpose is to keep weaving and merging traffic out of the through-lanes.
Some areas use a similar system, called <em>collector-express</em> or
<em>local-express</em> lanes.
A CD road is used to represent any of these configurations, in addition to any
other ramps which cannot be described with a simple entrance or exit node type.
An exit ramp which splits into two ramps leading to different roads may be
called a "CD road".
This allows complex geometrics to be modelled without a complex database schema.
</p>
<p>
Each CD road is treated as a separate corridor (for example, with a roadway
called "I-394 CD").
If there are multiple CD roads for one freeway, they can share the same
roadway.
</p>
<h2>Reversible Roads</h2>
<p>
A <em>reversible road</em> is a roadway with movable barracades to allow the
flow of traffic to be reversed.
This allows a roadway to flow one direction in the AM, and reversed in the PM.
This type of roadway should be modelled with each direction separately, since
the entrance and exit ramps are not shared for the opposing flow directions.
