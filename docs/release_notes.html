		<li>
			There were various other database changes.
			Communication Line renamed to Comm Link.
			Controller170 merged into Controller.

			change these objects.

			"Comm Links" GUI.
			Some features are missing from this new interface
			(error counters and test communications), but they

		</li>
		<li>
			The "log" database is no longer required for IRIS
			operation.
			Tables from "log" database moved to "event" schema
			in the "tms" database.
			This means the IRIS server requires one less connection
			to the PostgreSQL server.
			It also adds some foreign key relationships between
			the schemas.
			Some additional database scripts will be required to
			retain "log" database event history.
			Also, a cron task should be set up to remove old
			records from the event.comm_event table (many events
			will be created per day).

			modified to give administrators permission to change
			these objects.

			pattern of "geo_loc/.*".
		</li>
		<li>
			SONAR dependency updated to 1.7.3.
		</li>
