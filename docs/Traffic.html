<h1>MnDOT Traffic Data Archive</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
	For many years, MnDOT has collected traffic data from sensors
	(detectors) embedded in the roadway.
	As of October 2006, data is
	being collected every 30 seconds from more than 4500 detectors in the
	Twin Cities metro area.  This raw data usually consists of volume
	(number of vehicles, sometimes called "flow") and occupancy (percentage
	of time a detector is "occupied").  As you might guess, this adds up to
	a very large amount of data every day.  There is so much data that the
	advantages of storing it in a traditional database are far outweighed
	by the complications.i
	This data storage problem led to the development of the MnDOT
	<b>Traffic Data Archive</b>, in March 2000.
	Freeway data from January 1994 onwards is available in this format.
</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>
	There are many benefits to the unified traffic data file format.
	Probably the most important benefit is simplicity. Earlier file formats
	had complicated bit field manipulation, which made it harder to develop
	data analysis tools.  This problem has been eliminated, since all data
	is stored as either 8-bit or 16-bit binary integers.  Another benefit
	is the compactness of the format.  In earlier formats, this quantity of
	data would occupy 33 megabytes (MB) of disk space.  In this format, the
	same data is compressed into about 13 MB (with no loss of precision).
	Another problem with earlier formats was the distinction between
	30-second, 5-minute, and station samples made accessing the data more
	complex than it needed to be.  This format unifies all the data into a
	single file, simplifying the software needed to access the data.
	Another key benefit of the format is extensibility.  It is possible
	to add different types of data (such as speed, vehicle classification,
	etc.) to the format without sacrificing backward compatibility.
</p>
<h2>File Format</h2>
<p>
	Each traffic data file consists of one day's worth of traffic data.
	The files are conventionally named with an eight-digit date (four-digit
	year, two-digit month and two-digit day), plus an extension of
	".traffic".  For example, a file called "20000323.traffic" would contain
	all the detector data for March 23, 2000.  The file itself is actually
	in the popular ZIP compression format, making it easy to extract data
	using tools such as WinZip.
</p>
<p>
	Within the traffic archive, there will be one or more files for each
	detector.  These files are named according to the detector from which
	the data was collected.  The base file name is the detector ID, and the
	filename extension determines the type of sample data.  For example,
	30-second volume samples collected from detector ID 100 would be stored
	in a file called "100.v30".

<h3>30-second Sample Data</h3>
<p>
	The 30-second sample files (.?30) contain binned sample data for all
	2880 30-second periods in the day.  The first sample represents the
	first 30-seconds of the day (midnight to 00:00:30), and the last sample
	is the last 30-seconds of the day (23:59:30 to midnight).  Each data
	sample is either an 8 or 16 bit signed integer, depending on the sample
	type.  16-bit samples are in high-byte first order.  A negative value
	(-1) indicates a missing sample.  Any data outside the valid ranges
	should be considered "bad".
</p>
<p>
	The .v30 sample data is the number of vehicles sampled at the detector
	in 30 seconds.  A volume sample of 40 vehicles or higher should never
	happen in the real world, since that represents a sustained average
	headway of 0.75 seconds between vehicles.
</p>
<p>
	The .o30 format is now obsolete, having been replaced by the
	more-precise .c30 format.  Scans are defined as 1/60 second, so the
	valid range for a sample is 0 to 1800 (30 seconds * 60 scans/second).
	The old .o30 files are in 1/10th percent occupancy, so they range from
	0 to 1000.  That is the only difference between the two file formats.
	If you want to get numbers in the range of 0 to 100, divide scan data
	by 18 or occupancy data by 10.
</p>
<p>
	The .s30 sample data is raw speed data from radar or microwave sensors.
	Each sample is the average speed in miles/hour.
</p>
<h3>Individual Vehicle Logging</h3>
<p>
	The .vlog data is a text (ascii) format with one line for each vehicle
	detection event.  Duration, headway, and speed can be logged using the
	.vlog format.  Values are separated by commas, and missing data is
	represented by a '?' field.  A gap in the sampling data is represented
	by a '*' on a line by itself.
